                         Simple F2F Network Library
                         --------------------------


Gjoll is a C library for building secure F2F networks, useful for bypassing NAT
restrictions and enabling a trusted group of people to communicate online using
a flexible and secure backend. The Gjoll library uses a central router to relay
information to and from nodes on the network, and makes development very easy.
